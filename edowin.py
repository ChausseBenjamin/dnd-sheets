backstory = """

    Edowin Bloodthorne, a Drow Warlock,  was once part of a tight-knit band of
    thieves, but in a fateful heist, his own comrades,  betrayed him by
    offering his sister up as bait to a rival drow faction, using her as a
    distraction to escape with the loot. As a result, his sister was kidnapped
    and condemned to a life of slavery and rape, with no intentions of rescue
    from her former comrades.

    Shocked by this turn of events, Edowin tried to slauther his own, attempting to
    avenge his sister. However, he was young and inexperienced. His act of heroism
    nearly cost him his very life.

    In this darkest hour, he encountered an Empyrean, a celestial being of
    unimaginable power. The Empyrean offered him a pact, a pact that would grant
    him abilities beyond his wildest dreams. Fueled by his deep disdain for the
    darkness that had consumed his drow kin, Edowin accepted the pact with the
    celestial, choosing the path of light and righteousness, the polar opposite of
    what a drow would normally prefer. Even though light targetting the Warlock is
    bound to hurt him, Edowin's hands were blessed with the power to cast spells
    of light and fire with no ill effects.
